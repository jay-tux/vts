# VTS - Jay.VTS.Execution.BlockParse
**Obsolete class, code should be moved into the StackFrame class.**
The BlockParse class contains a single static method which converts a LineElement to an Expression. However, all of the actual work is done in the SplitExpression class.  

The second method uses calls the first, but using a CodeBlock instead of a LineElement.
